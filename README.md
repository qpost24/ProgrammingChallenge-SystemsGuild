# ProgrammingChallenge-SystemsGuild
A solution to a programming challenge given to me by Systems Guild, Inc. as a part of the job application process.

The task is to create an application that accesses the AdventureWorks2017 database from Microsoft. The application is meant to allow a user to input a postal code and time range. This would then return the average dollar per transaction for that zipcode in the time range provided as well as the average dollar per transaction for the region.

My solution uses C# and .Net to access the SQL Server on the local machine using the Windows authorization.
